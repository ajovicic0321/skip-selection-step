## üõ† Technical Approach

### Architecture

### Key Technologies
- **React 18**: Latest React with functional components and hooks
- **CSS3**: Modern CSS with custom properties (CSS variables)
- **Fetch API**: Native browser API for HTTP requests
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques for responsiveness

## üé® Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary Blue**: #2563eb (brand color, buttons, highlights)
- **Secondary Green**: #10b981 (success states, popular badges)
- **Accent Orange**: #f59e0b (skip imagery, warnings)
- **Gray Scale**: #f9fafb to #111827 (text, backgrounds, borders)

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter (professional, readable)
- **Scale**: Modular type scale from 0.75rem to 2.25rem
- **Weights**: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold), 700 (bold)

### Spacing & Layout
- **Grid System**: CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints
- **Spacing Scale**: 0.25rem to 6rem in logical increments
- **Border Radius**: Consistent rounded corners (0.375rem to 1rem)
- **Shadows**: Layered shadow system for depth and hierarchy

## üì± Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 640px (1 column grid, stacked navigation)
- **Tablet**: 640px - 1024px (2 column grid, horizontal navigation)
- **Desktop**: > 1024px (3 column grid, full layout)

## üîß Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone/Download the project files**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project directory
   cd skip-selection-redesign
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - The page will automatically reload when you make changes

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## üñºÔ∏è Image Configuration

The application supports configurable image base URLs for different deployment environments:

### Environment Variable Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root to configure the image base URL:

```bash
# For local development (default - images served from public folder)
REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE_URL=

# For production with CDN
REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://cdn.yoursite.com

# For production with different domain
REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://assets.yoursite.com

# For staging environment
REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://staging-assets.yoursite.com
```

### Usage Examples

- **Local Development**: Leave `REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE_URL` empty or unset to serve images from the `public/images/` folder
- **Production with CDN**: Set to your CDN domain to load images from a content delivery network
- **Different Domain**: Point to a separate assets server or subdomain

### How It Works

The `SkipCard` component automatically prepends the base URL to all image paths:
- If `REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE_URL` is empty: `/images/4-yarder-skip.jpg`
- If `REACT_APP_IMAGE_BASE_URL` is set: `https://cdn.yoursite.com/images/4-yarder-skip.jpg`

This allows for flexible image hosting without code changes between environments.
